# Finger Counter with OpenCV Python
Finger Counter Implementation with OpenCV

One of the most important image processing applications is the finger counter project. The software I developed using Python-OpenCV can detect and analyze the hand image in real time camera thanks to its contour tools. Our algorithm, which can extract the number of fingers from the color, position and orientation information of the fingers, gives integer output from 0 to 5. This output becomes important in terms of running a different command against a different number of fingers.
